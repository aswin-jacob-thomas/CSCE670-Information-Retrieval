    "# Homework 1:  Information Retrieval Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 100 points [7% of your final grade]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due: January 31 (Friday) by 11:59pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Goals of this homework:* In this homework you will get first hand experience building a text-based mini search engine. In particular, there are three main learning objectives: (i) the basics of tokenization (e.g. stemming, case-folding, etc.) and its effect on information retrieval; (ii) basics of index building and Boolean retrieval; and (iii) basics of the Vector Space model and ranked retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission instructions (eCampus):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw1.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw1.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the 5 total allotted to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: I found helpful code on stackoverflow at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz that helped me solve Problem 2.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

Each flashcard generated by a user is made up of an entity on the front and a definition describing or explaining the entity correspondingly on the back. We treat entities on each flashcard's front as the queries and the definitions on the back of flashcards as the documents. Definitions (documents) are relevant to an entity (query) if the definitions are from the back of the entity's flashcard; otherwise definitions are not relevant. **In this homework, queries and entities are interchangeable as well as documents and definitions.**\n",

    "Could your boolean search engine find relevant documents for these queries? What is the impact of the three pre-processing options? Do they improve your search quality?\n",

    "Answer: Boolean retrieval finds most of the relevant documents for the queries. But since it is not taking the ranking of the documents into consideration, users are not getting the best results. For instance, for the query, \"relational database\", boolean retrieval is not returning the best document returned by TF-IDF model out of the 5 documents returned. \n",
    "Yes,preprocessing improves the search quality considerably. For instance, without stemming, no documents are returned for the query \"retrieval model\". But with stemming, more accurate results are obtained. The reason is that many words like retrievals, retrieve, retrieving gets converted to retriev. This helps the model to return document matches. Also preprocessing the words reduces the size of the vocabulary by over 40%. This will greatly improve the latency of the queries."

    "Answer: The main issue with all the three models is that all of them considers documents as bag of words and not considering the relative positions of the query terms. This factor can greatly alter the ranking of the documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vector Space Model is the most intuitive out of all three models. Since each document and query is considered as a vector, finding the similarity between the vectors provides an inherent idea of the relevance. It is also scaled between 0 and 1. This normalization also helps in visualizing the relevance of the document. BM25 gave the best precision@5 out of the three methods, but it is hard to visualize the scoring idea behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF model does only consider the query terms in the documents and completely ignores the weightage of other words in the document. This can bring in very long documents containing the query terms, but may not be relevant to the query term.\n",
    "Sinve Vector Space Model is taking in all the terms in the entire vocabulary in consideration while scoring, the scores for longer documents will be very low even the tf values are higher for such documents. The normalization factor hurts for such documents. So this model tends to return shorted documents for which the normalization factor is small.\n",
